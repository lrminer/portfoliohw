            Hello! My name is Kevin Kyle. I attended Clemson University & Kennesaw State for undergrad, where I played on the baseball team. I graduated from KSU in 2014 with a bachelor's degree in finance. I've created and managed two software projects over the last two years. The first is a .NET app for sales prospecting which utilizes Google's Custom Search API. The other is a Python app used for searching local building codes, which includes a web based document viewer and form editor.

            I believe I bring unique experience to software development having gained over four years of sales experience at two large corporations: Ferguson Enterprises & ConstructConnect. The latter position involved selling an enterprise SaaS application. I have hands on experience with Google API's, Elasticsearch, Heroku, and various database management tools.
        </p>

            I was born and raised in Atlanta. My hobbies include NFL Football, running at Piedmont Park, and Georgia Tech basketball. Work philosophy: I believe most problems, business or personal, can be solved by significantly increasing the amount of focus and attention to those problems. I plan to incorporate this attitude into any of the work I do for my clients until a desirable outcome is achieved.
